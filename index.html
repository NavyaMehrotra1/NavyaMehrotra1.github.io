                    <p class="description">I'm a CS + Econ student at Johns Hopkins, with minors in Applied Mathematics & Statistics, and Financial Economics (maybe computational medicine too?). 
                        <br> I'm passionate about building projects/research/startups with tech that have the potential to help people. I like to view technology in terms of its beauty but also the impact it can have on people. 
                        <br>
                        <br> I am currently working on CS and econ research at Johns Hopkins. I am building Delineo (working with WHO to simulate and stop diseases), researching causal inference in empirical studies through the BDP research fellowship, helping build BlueJay programming language, and working on an upcoming NLP project.
                        <br> 
                        <br> Aside from research, I love creating community of people who love CS and econ as much as I do. Fall 2025: Starting Data Science Club @ JHU, VP @ HopAI, Secretary @ WiCS and Treasurer @ SWE. When I'm not working on a structured projects, I like learning for fun (currently learning: language modeling).
